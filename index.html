        <h2>Visualization for the bushfire in Australia happend from (around) October 1 2019 to Janurary 31 2020</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Some context for this visualization to the general audience</h2>
        <p>This visualization work aims to provide you an understanding on the bushfire situation in AU during the period captioned.</p>
        <p>Before looking into the visualization, there are a few points to clarify in order to prepare you with a more solid context.</p>
        <p><strong>About data source</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data is collected by the satellite (MODIS 6) from NASA. This is a project called FIRE INFORMATION FOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FIRMS) of NASA.</li>
            <li>You can download data from <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/">here</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>About data attributes</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Brightness: According to NASA, the Brightness is referred to as brightness temperature: Channel 31 brightness temperature of the fire pixel measured in Kelvin.</li>
            <li>Day/Night time: This indicates the time when the satellite collects the data as there are different algorithms for detecting the temperature anomalies.</li>
            <li>Note that in our visualization interface, we can manipulate whether display the data by day or night. But in comparision view, both day and night time data will be counted.</li>
            <li>Confidence: It indicates the confidence of identifying the anomaly as a burning point. We adpoted 60% as a general treatment according to NASA.</li>
            <li>More info on data attributes can be found in <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/what-is-new-collection-6-modis-active-fire-data">here</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>About the visualization</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>As this assignment is focusing on the visualization, the loading speed/interruption issue is existing since the dataset size is big (60M).</li>
            <li>You may experience the delay or interruption due to the size of dataset, in this case, please refresh the page.Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</li>
            <li>It should be smooth when the page opens successfully:)</li>
        </ol>
